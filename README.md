## Brian Turnbo
I am interested in:
*Video Games, because it's like a getaway from all the complicated in my life
*Basketball, because you never know what's going to happen
*Math, because no matter what math is universal
### Technical Background 
I've been prgramming since 2015, but I took a long break from coding recently. Before that break my experience was:
*C++ (2yr) 
*Java(1yr) (It's not my favorite but I manage)
*Swift(~3yr) (Honestly is my favorite) 
I also coded in the dreaded Assembly Language.
